# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata is a practice for handling a legacy code situation, and is also really useful for practicing writing good tests using different frameworks and approaches.

## How I used this Kata

I cloned the code and started improving the design after looking at the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt) which explains what the code is for. And I wrote tests to make sure you don't break the code while I refactor it incrementally.

I added the following branches to practice doing this exercise different languages:
